## Real-time kill tracker for Star Citizen

### What is AyeSpy?
AyeSpy is a **proof of concept** made to demonstrate the feasibility of a Star Citizen kill tracker overlay. AyeSpy is made with JS and HTML. It is unoptimized and not intended to be used as a finished application.

# Warning: This app WILL trigger Windows defender

#### Due to leaving the app unsigned, Windows defender will flag the app as made by an unknown author. To proceed, click more info and run anyways. 

# Usage
- After installation, click the 'Select Logfile to Watch' button and select your Star Citizen Game.log file. By default, the file will be located in 'C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\Game.log'.
- Once you have selected the watch path, turn on the overlay and configure it to your liking. Setting the feed cull rate or feed max length to '-1' will disable the respective option.
